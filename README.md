# websocket [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kochman/websocket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kochman/websocket)&nbsp;[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/kochman/websocket?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/kochman/websocket)

A wrapper around `github.com/gorilla/websocket` to make writing WebSocket servers and clients in Go simpler. Instead of writing a bunch of code to track connections and shuffle data into and out of them, you can just focus on just writing and reading arbitrary bytes.
